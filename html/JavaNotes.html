            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <div class="plainText">Java is a <em>platform-independent</em> programming language. This means  a Java program written once will run anywhere (that you can run java)!</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is thanks to the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, responsible for executing Java code on a device. 
                </li>
                <li>Machine-specific JVM's take the onus of platform dependence off the code itself.
                </li>
            </ul>

            The source file is the name for the java file as a whole. It's standard practice to only include one class per source file, as the file is named after the class contained within.


        </div>
        <div class="databox">
            <h2>The Class &amp; The Object</h2>
            Java, as an object oriented language, deals heavily with objects.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An object represents a "module" of a program, containing state and behavior, represented by variables and methods respectively.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Every java application must have at least one class, and one main method per application.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A class holds the methods (functions) and variables necessary for your project's or object's operation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The main method is the entry point of a Java program.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Classes are used as blueprints for creating objects.
        </div>

            <h2>Running a Java Program</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A java file consists, broadly, of three components: Classes, Methods, and Statements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write your java code in the source document, a.k.a the source file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compile your code to ensure it will run without forseeable errors. This turns it into Java bytecode.
                <li>
                    Run the compiled Java bytecode on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the software installed on devices which used to run Java code.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            This is what goes inside:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Methods are the programming in computer programming. They contain statements directed toward fulfilling a particular function. They're` reusable packets of code 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's standard practice to only include one class per source file, as the file is named after the class contained within. Classes are referenced by file name so having multiple classes oin one source file would be counterproductive.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="databox">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                Variables in java are strictly typed as primitive or reference.<br><br>
                Primitive:
                <ul>
                    <li>Integer: </li>
                </ul>
                Reference variables are those that appear to "hold" objects within them.
                <br><br>
                Rules for naming them are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        should start with: A-Z, _, or $. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any character folllwing may be a number.
                    </li>
                    <li>No reserved keywords. </li>
                </ul>
                In statments such as x=x+3, the expression is evaluated before assignment.
