        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a paragraph element.
            This is used to subdivide larger blocks of text into sections.</p>

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Test Article Heading</h2>
    <div>
        <article>
            This is a of the article element. Let's test what it does. Nothing, it seems.
        </article>
        <blockquote class="orange">
            Blockquote with class "orange", a test of inheritance. Now let's see how a paragraph element, with a broadly applied style, is formatted.
            <p>
                Test paragraph
            </p>
            If it didnt have formatting it would adopt the formatting of its parent elemenet, and it would be orange and show in the default font.

    An interesting way of doing things in activity one of the Learn HTML5 Programming book. It's a Print To Document program that writes out a wall of text consisting of the "99 bottles of beer on the wall" sea shanty lyrics, listed from 99 to 1. How they executed this task has me wondering about efficiency in my future projects.<br>
    <br>
    The program's main loop, responsible for generating the text displayed on the page, does not print the text to the page directly. It adds new lines of text, broken up with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements, to a single string variable responsible for storing the entirety of the generated lyrics for the shanty. It uses recursive concatenation to add new lyrics to the variable via string = string + newStringMaterial.
    <br>
    This reminds me of a lesson one of my computer science teachers drilled into me: the dangers of invoking a method within another method. It's apparently considered inefficient as the program needs to stop its flow every time a method is called and start, for lack of a better term and general deeper understanding, a new thread in which the encountered method is processed.
    I hope this is addressed in the book, as I still have no idea how big O notation works.
