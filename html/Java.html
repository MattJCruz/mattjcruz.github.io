            <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
            Java is a platform-independent programming language. This means you can write a program once and it'll run anywhere (you can run java)!<br>
            <h4>Running a Java Program</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A java file consists, broadly, of three components: Classes, Methods, and Statements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write your java code in the source document, a.k.a the source file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compile your code to ensure it will run without forseeable errors. This turns it into Java bytecode.
                <li>
                    Run the compiled Java bytecode on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the software installed on devices which used to run Java code.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Anatomy of a Java Program</h4><br>
            This is what goes inside:
            <ul>
                <h4>Methods</h4>
                <li>
                    Methods are the programming in computer programming. They contain statements directed toward fulfilling a particular function. They're reusable packets of code 
                </li>
                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <li>
                    It's standard practice to only include one class per source file, as the file is named after the class contained within. Classes are referenced by file name so having multiple classes oin one source file would be counterproductive.
                </li>
                <h4>Statements, Loops, &amp; Branches</h4>
            </ul>
            In statments such as x=x+3, the expression is evaluated before assignment. 
            <br><br>
            Variable names should start with: A-Z, _, or $.
            <br><br>
            Anythingafterward can contain a number.
