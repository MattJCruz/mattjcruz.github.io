            Java is a platform-independent programming language. This means you can write a program once and it'll run anywhere (you can run java)!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A java file consists, broadly, of three components: Classes, Methods, and Statements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The source file is the name for the java file as a whole. It's standard practice to only include one class per source file, as the file is named after the class contained within.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Within a class go the methods (functions) and variables necessary for your project's operation.
                </li>
                <li>
                Every java application must have at least one class, and one main method per application.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
