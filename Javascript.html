            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            I will not be including basic programming definitions, i.e. variables, booleans, if statements etc.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Javascript is a scripting language, a programming language that's interpreted or compiled at runtime, as opposed to being compiled before runtime as is usually the case with Object Oriented Programs.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Declare variables with the <code>var</code> keyword.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Name variables starting with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and every subsequent character can be one of the above or a number.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Additionally they're case-sensitive. NUM1 and num1 are two different variable names.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Application Programming Interfaces (API's) are used to access additional functionality beyond the scope of a simple program.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    End statments with a semicolon.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Strings are surrounded with double quotes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    A variable with a set value will be considered true in a boolean expression, while an empty one will be considered false.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Use console.log to write to the javascript console in your environment.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                To write to an HTML document in Javascript, use the <code>document.write</code> function. This is not recommended as there are (apparently?) better ways to do this.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
